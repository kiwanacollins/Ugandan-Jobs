                <p>Practice common interview questions and answers, research the company, and prepare questions to ask the interviewer. Dress appropriately and arrive on time. Being well-prepared will boost your confidence.</p>
                <p><strong>What should I do if I don't get the job?</strong></p>
                <p>Don't get discouraged. Ask for feedback from the interviewer to understand what you can improve. Keep applying to other jobs and use each interview experience as a learning opportunity.</p>
